I encountered an issue on my website, Bigmomba.netlify.app, where the form appears excessively large and does not fit properly within the design layout. This makes it difficult for users to fill out the form and navigate the page.

Issue Description:

URL: Bigmomba.netlify.app/(please specify the exact page URL where the issue occurs).
Problem: 
Expected Behavior: 
Current Behavior: 


Visit the page [provide URL if it's a specific one].

Additional Notes:

The issue persists on (desktop, tablet, and mobile) devices.

Please look into this issue at your earliest convenience to improve the website's functionality and ensure a better user experience on the site.
